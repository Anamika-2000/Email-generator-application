## Usage

 The email application can be used in a large organization to facilitate the creation and management of employee email accounts.
 
## Description

The above project is an email application that allows users to create an email account associated with a company name and department name. It is implemented using Java and interacts with a MySQL database for storing information related to the employees.

The application begins by asking the user to enter their first name, last name, and phone number. Based on this information, an employee ID is generated by taking the initial letter of the first name and concatenating it with the phone number.

Next,the company email address is generated based on the provided information, including the user's first name, last name, company name and department. The user is prompted to enter their alternate email address and a new password.  

After generating the email address and password, the application establishes a connection with the MySQL database. It inserts a new record into the "Dataemail" table, which includes fields for the employee ID, email address, first name , last name , phone number and password.

The application handles database operations using Java's JDBC API. It loads the MySQL JDBC driver, establishes a connection to the database, and prepares an SQL INSERT statement using a prepared statement. The employee ID, email address, and password are set as parameters in the prepared statement before executing it. The application then checks the number of rows affected by the INSERT operation to determine the success or failure of the record insertion.

Overall, this project demonstrates the implementation of an email application with basic employee management functionality, including generating employee IDs, creating email addresses, setting passwords, and storing employee information in a MySQL database.

## Pre-Requisites

Run the application: Compile and run the Email_app class in a Java development environment or execute the compiled Java bytecode.

Provide employee information: When prompted, enter the employee's first name, last name, and phone number. The application will generate an employee ID based on the provided information.

Set up the email account: The application will generate an email address based on the employee's information, including their first name, last name, and department. The generated email address will be displayed on the screen. Optionally, you can provide an alternate email address for the employee.

Set a One Time Password(OTP): A new one time password is generated corresponding to each email-id to login.

Set a new password: Enter a password for the email account when prompted. The password will be displayed on the screen. This password can be used to login afterwards.

Store the employee record: The application will connect to a MySQL database and store the employee's information, including the employee ID, email address, and password.

Usage of the email account: Provide the generated email address and password to the employee. They can now use these credentials to access their email account and send/receive emails.

Additional functionality: The application provides additional features such as setting the mailbox capacity and changing the password for the email account. These options can be accessed by calling the appropriate methods on the Email object.
